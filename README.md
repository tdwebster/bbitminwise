# bbitminwise
<p>An implementation of b bit min wise hashing. </p>
<p>This file is designed to implement the methods 2.2 in the first paper bellow. The other papers are given for further reading and features: <ul>
<li>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1269v3.pdf</li>
<li>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2958v1.pdf </li>

It implements method 2.2 for performing bBit Minwise Hashing on sparse binary data sets. There is scope to expand this project to implement other methods in this paper, especially for continous data. There is also space to improve the efficiency of the code.</p>
<p>Created under supervision of Dr Rajen Shah and supported by the Bridgewater program. This code was developed as part of a summer reaserch project at the Univerisity of Cambridge on Machine Learning which looked, in part, at b bit min wise hashing.</p>
<p>The code in this project is free to use under a CC-BY license, you are free to use and moify this code for whatever purpose you see fit however please keep the atribution. This project is no longer under active development however I am happy to be contacted regarding potential bug fixes, the easiest way to do such would be submitting an issue or making a pull request. Any enhancements are welcomed similarly and I can discuss via email.</p>
